# Center for High Order Plasma Turbulence Modeling for Z-Pinch (HighZ)

The overarching goal of this Focused Investigatory Center (FIC) is to develop high-order numerical methods and scientific machine learning techniques that will be applied to the modeling and interpretation of plasmas of fluid and fluid-adjacent regimes, with a particular emphasis on turbulence in magnetized plasmas and radiative magnetic reconnection - two areas of fundamental interest to the Department of Energy, and proxies for a range of plasma phenomena applicable to high energy density physics experiments and fusion energy such as Z pinches. The numerical methods developed will include high-order, positivity-preserving finite difference, finite volume, and discontinuous Galerkin methods for extended magnetohydrodynamics, equipped with novel implicit/semiimplicit time-stepping methods. The scientific machine learning methods we develop will be designed to address the multiscale nature of the targeted plasma applications and will focus on preserving physical structures for enforcing model consistency, extending model reduction techniques to reduce the computational cost in large-scale fluid simulations, and the development of a subgrid model for magnetized turbulence
