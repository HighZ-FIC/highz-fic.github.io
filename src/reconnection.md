## Overview


High order scalable open source solvers, further enhanced by ML/AI sub-grid models, are an enabling technology in the context of modeling high Lundquist number multi-scale plasma flows. These methods will enable resolution of magnetic turbulent and reconnection regimes that are well beyond what is possible on the leadership exascale compute platforms with existing methods.
